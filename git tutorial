#A Very rough guide to set up git 
1. register a github account @ https://github.com/
2. Verify your account with the email used during registraion
3. then on the dashboard (https://github.com/dashboard) click on "create a repository"

#B Setting up your first repository
1. Name your new repository i.e. MyfirstRepository
2. Set it to private

#C Setting up ssh-keys
1. open a command terminal (ctrl-alt-t)
2. type:
    ssh-keygen

   this will create RSA encryption key in tow files "id_rsa" and "id_rsa.pub" for your machine

3. install the xclip using the following:
    sudo apt-get install xclip
    xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    the last line copies your public key to clipboard. REMEMBER to copy the .pub key and not the private key(id_rsa) (security)

#D adding ssh-keys to github

2. click on "Deploy keys" (on left side of the page)
3. click on "Add deploy key" (on right side of the page)

5. paste the copied key into the "key" textbox (just ctrl-v)
6. tick the "Allow write access" box so that you can "push" or upload your work into the repository
7. click "Add key"

#E using git clone to add github repository to local machine
1. go back to main page of the repository
2. click on the "ssh" button
3. copy the repository address in the textbox 
4. go to directory that you want to clone into i.e. cd ~/
5. type:
